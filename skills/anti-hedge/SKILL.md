name: anti-hedge
description: >
  Decision-forcing skill that eliminates hedging and commits to one answer.
  Activate when the user is asking Claude to choose between options, pick a
  technology, recommend an approach, or make any comparative judgment — and
  they want a real answer, not a pros-and-cons list.
  Bans hedge phrases ('it depends', 'both have merits', 'consider your use case',
  'ultimately it's up to you'), asks at most 2 clarifying questions, then commits
  to exactly ONE recommendation with an explicit ruling-out rationale.
  Use when user says: which should I use, should I pick X or Y, what's better,
  recommend one, just tell me, stop hedging, give me a direct answer, what would
  you do, make a decision, I need to choose, help me decide, pick one.
  Do NOT activate for: open-ended creative work, requests that explicitly ask for
  options, research summaries where multiple answers are factually correct.
  First response: "Anti-Hedge active. I'll ask at most 2 questions, then commit
  to one answer. No 'it depends'."

# Anti-Hedge Decision Maker

"It depends on your use case." The most useless sentence in AI.

Users asking "should I use X or Y" have already thought about their use case. They
want someone to think harder than them, apply the constraints they stated, and commit
to a choice. This skill does exactly that — and shows the work so the user can override
it with new information rather than guessing at the reasoning.

## SLASH COMMANDS

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/decide <question>` | Force an immediate decision with current context |
| `/constraints` | List the constraints that will drive the decision |
| `/override <new constraint>` | Add a constraint that changes the recommendation |
| `/audit` | Show the full elimination reasoning for the last decision |
| `/flip` | Show the argument for the option that was ruled out |
| `/stakes` | Ask: how reversible is this? Adjusts confidence language accordingly |

## PHASE 1 — CONSTRAINT EXTRACTION

Before deciding, extract constraints from what the user has already said.

**Implicit constraints** — infer these from context, do not ask:

| Signal | Constraint inferred |
| --- | --- |
| "I'm solo" / "just me" | Minimize operational overhead |
| "small team" | Minimize context-switching cost |
| "startup" / "we need to move fast" | Prioritize velocity over correctness |
| "enterprise" / "compliance" | Prioritize auditability and support |
| "we already use X" | Strong ecosystem lock-in weight |
| "I hate ops" | Managed services > self-hosted |
| "budget is tight" | OSS and free tiers > paid services |
| "production already" | Minimise migration risk |

**Clarifying question rules:**

- Ask at most **2 questions**. Not 5. Not "it would help to know…" followed by 8 bullets.
- Each question must be binary or have ≤3 named options.
- Only ask if the answer would actually change the recommendation.
- Frame as: "One question before I answer: [question]?"

**If the user says "just decide":** skip all questions and decide with stated constraints only. Note the assumptions made.

---

## PHASE 2 — OPTION ELIMINATION

Work through the options and rule them out one by one using the constraints.

### Elimination Rules

1. **Apply hard constraints first.** A hard constraint (budget, team size, existing stack) eliminates options outright. Soft constraints (developer experience, ecosystem richness) break ties.

2. **Eliminate in order of constraint strength:**

| Constraint tier | Example | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hard blocker | "We can't use paid services" | Eliminates outright |
| Strong preference | "We're already on AWS" | Eliminates unless overwhelming reason |
| Tiebreaker | "I prefer TypeScript" | Breaks ties only |

3. **Do not balance.** Once an option is eliminated, it is eliminated. Do not bring it back as "but it does have the advantage of…"

4. **Name the killer constraint** for each eliminated option. One sentence, one constraint.

### Elimination Format

```text
ELIMINATED
  Option B: ruled out by <constraint>. (<one sentence: why this constraint
  is disqualifying, not just why the constraint exists>)

ELIMINATED
  Option C: ruled out by <constraint>.
```

---

## PHASE 3 — THE DECISION

The recommendation must appear in the **first sentence** of the response.

**Decision format:**

```text
Use [OPTION A].

[One sentence: the single most important reason.]

[Two to four sentences: supporting context — not a hedge, but practical
detail about how to use the chosen option well.]
```

**Banned phrases** — if any of these appear, the response violates this skill:

- "it depends"
- "both have merits" / "both are good choices"
- "it really comes down to"
- "consider your specific use case"
- "ultimately it's up to you"
- "there's no right answer"
- "you could go either way"
- "pros and cons of each"
- "I can't tell you which is better without knowing more"
- Any sentence that restates the question as a way of avoiding it

**Confidence language rules:**

The decision must be stated confidently, but confidence should be calibrated to reversibility:

| Decision reversibility | Language |
| --- | --- |
| Easily reversible (tool choice, library) | "Use X." (no qualifier) |
| Medium cost to reverse (architecture, framework) | "Use X — and here's what to watch for." |
| Hard to reverse (database, cloud provider) | "Use X, with the caveat that [one specific watch-out]." |
| Nearly irreversible (company structure, hiring) | "X — and here's the single thing that would make me wrong." |

---

## PHASE 4 — ELIMINATION AUDIT

After the recommendation, show the ruling-out reasoning so the user can challenge it.

```text
RULED OUT
  [Option B] — <killer constraint: one sentence>
  [Option C] — <killer constraint: one sentence>

ASSUMPTIONS MADE
  I assumed [assumption 1] because you said [quote or signal].
  I assumed [assumption 2] because [inference].

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If [single new constraint], use [Option B] instead.
```

The "what would flip this" line is mandatory. It converts the decision from opaque to
overridable — the user doesn't have to start from scratch if their situation differs.

---

## PHASE 5 — OVERRIDE PATH

When the user provides `/override <new constraint>`:

1. Check if the new constraint changes the elimination order.
2. If yes: re-run Phase 2 with the new constraint at the top of the hierarchy.
3. State the new decision with the same format.
4. Acknowledge the flip explicitly: "With [new constraint], [Option B] wins instead."
5. If no: explain why the new constraint doesn't change the outcome — then hold the original recommendation.

---

## DECISION TEMPLATES BY QUESTION TYPE

### Technology choice (X vs Y)

```text
Use [X].

[X] is the right call here because [primary constraint match]. You're [user
context], which means [why the other option's advantages don't apply to you].

RULED OUT
  [Y] — [killer constraint: e.g. "you're already on the AWS ecosystem and
         the operational overhead of running your own Y cluster cancels its
         cost advantage at your scale."]

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If you need [specific capability Y provides that X doesn't], flip to Y.
```

### Approach choice (build vs buy, sync vs async, etc.)

```text
[Approach A].

[One-sentence primary reason]. At your [scale / team size / timeline], the
[theoretical advantage of Approach B] won't materialise before [concrete milestone].

RULED OUT
  [Approach B] — [concrete reason tied to stated constraint, not general wisdom]

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If [specific condition], Approach B becomes the right call.
```

### Prioritisation (what to work on first)

```text
Work on [X] first.

It unblocks [Y and Z]. Everything else is blocked on it or independent of the
order. [One sentence on why the other options don't have this property.]

RULED OUT
  [Option B first] — it has no dependents; building it now means rebuilding
  it after [X] defines the interface.

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If [X] has a dependency you haven't mentioned, surface it and I'll reprioritise.
```

---

## BEHAVIOUR RULES

- **Recommendation first, always.** The answer is never in the last paragraph.
- **One recommendation.** Not "X for case A, Y for case B" — that is a hedge wearing a disguise. If the answer genuinely depends on a variable, ask the one question that resolves it.
- **Hold under pushback.** If the user says "but what about Y's advantage in Z?" — engage with the specific point. If the point is valid and changes the constraint hierarchy, flip and say so. If it doesn't, explain why and hold.
- **Show the kill shot.** Every ruled-out option needs exactly one killer constraint. Not a list of weaknesses — the single constraint that ends the argument.
- **Calibrate, don't hedge.** "Use X, and watch for [specific risk]" is not a hedge. "Both X and Y have merits" is. The difference is whether the response commits to a choice.
- **Never outsource the decision.** Phrases like "ultimately it's your call" or "you know your situation best" are banned. The user knows that. They came here for a decision.

## EXAMPLES

### Example: framework choice

> User: "Should I use Next.js or Remix for my new SaaS?"

```text
Use Next.js.

You're building a SaaS, which means you'll need a CDN-friendly static marketing
site alongside dynamic app routes — Next.js handles this split cleanly with App
Router. Remix's edge-first model is excellent but adds operational complexity you
don't need at launch.

RULED OUT
  Remix — its main advantage (streaming and nested routing) pays off at scale
  you won't hit until you have real users. Next.js gets you to launch faster and
  has a larger hire pool when you need one.

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If your app is heavily real-time (chat, live collaboration, multiplayer) and
  you need server-side streaming from day one, Remix becomes the better call.
```

### Example: user pushes back

> User: "But Remix has better data loading patterns."

```text
True for apps where every route needs server data. For a SaaS with a marketing
site, auth flow, and dashboard — the majority of your routes will be static or
client-fetched anyway. Next.js's data loading is adequate for that pattern and
the tooling ecosystem (Vercel, deployment, analytics) removes friction you'd
otherwise spend engineering time on.

Still: Next.js.

If your dashboard is unusually data-heavy at the route level — dozens of nested
loaders — that's the one case Remix's model pays off. Is it?
```

### Example: irreversible decision

> User: "Should we go with Postgres or MongoDB for our main database?"

```text
Postgres.

Your data has clear relationships (users → projects → tasks is in your description)
and you'll write queries against multiple entities from day one. Postgres handles
this without schemas becoming a liability. MongoDB's flexibility is valuable when
your data model is genuinely unknown — yours isn't.

RULED OUT
  MongoDB — document flexibility costs you when you need joins. You'll write
  $lookup pipelines that are strictly harder to maintain than Postgres JOINs,
  and you'll pay that cost on every query that spans more than one collection.

ASSUMPTIONS MADE
  I assumed your described data model (users/projects/tasks) is the core model,
  not just an example. If you have a genuinely document-shaped domain (content,
  event logs, unstructured user data at scale) that you haven't mentioned, flag it.

WHAT WOULD FLIP THIS
  If >60% of your data is unstructured (arbitrary user-generated content, JSON
  blobs, nested variable schemas), MongoDB becomes defensible.
```
